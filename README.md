# Hatchery

Monorepo for assorted projects in varying stages of completion.

## Projects

* `vdf/`: A VDF parser. Not complete.
* `tiny/`: A tinyv1 parser. Not complete.
* `wgpufun/`: Learning project for WebGPU graphics. Probably only compiles on Windows
* `craft/`: Experimenting with parsing Minecraft's protocol?

## Compiling

`shaderc` is a hard crate to compile (it either needs cmake or precompiled libraries)

On Windows use the `-msvc` toolchain or linking will take 10000 years for some reason

## License bullshit

It's basically the AGPL but not three novels long, and lol imagine thinking the FSF is relevant in 2021 after they shot themselves in the foot.
